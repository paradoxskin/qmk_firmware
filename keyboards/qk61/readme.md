## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 2 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the key at (0,0) in the matrix (Esc key) and plug in the keyboard
* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the back of the PCB

## Notes
- Keyboard doesn't work without VIA (`VIA_ENABLE = yes` in `rules.mk`), probably because of the proprietary library. I am not sure if it affects any features tho, except wasting space.
- You can use VIA by importing "CIDOO QK61 VIA.JSON" in https://usevia.app/. Open settings, enable "Show design tab" and load draft definition in this new design tab
